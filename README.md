# DBA_Conversations

**Scraping.py** is a Python script for web scraping that uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract data from DBA (Den Bl√• Avis).

## Prerequisites

Before using **scraping.py**, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python: You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- BeautifulSoup: Install BeautifulSoup with pip using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  ```

## Usage

Clone this repository or download the "scraping.py" script to your local machine.

Open the script in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

Customize the script for your specific scraping needs:

Set the URL of the website you want to scrape by replacing "your_DBA_item" with the target website's URL (e.g. "https://www.dba.dk/zigbee-kontakt-saelger-4-sl/id-1104546914/".

Save the script with your changes.
Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python scraping.py
```

The script will execute and begin scraping data from DBA.dk (remember to log in and follow the instructions in the terminal).

The scraped data will be saved to a text file ("conversation.txt") in the same directory as the script.
